# Freq â‡Œ Timeperiod Converter App using Python-Tkinter
Convert frequency to time-period and vice-versa

This Python application is a versatile tool built using the Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI) development. The app allows users to convert between frequency and time period values, providing a user-friendly interface and error-handling features.

## Features
- Two conversion modes: Users can select either "Frequency to Time Period" or "Time Period to Frequency" from the "Select Usage" dropdown menu to perform the desired conversion.
- Input and output units: Users can enter the frequency value and unit in the provided input fields and select the desired output unit from the dropdown menu. The app dynamically calculates and displays the corresponding output value.
- Automatic output recalculation: The app recalculates the output value every time the output unit is changed, providing real-time updates.
- Manual refresh option: Users can click the "Refresh" button to manually recalculate the output based on any change to the input values.

## Error Handling
- Input validation: The input field only accepts numerical characters, including integers and decimal points. Non-numerical characters will be ignored.
- Invalid unit detection: If the user inputs any invalid units, the app displays a pop-up error message, notifying the user about the issue.

## Usage
1. Run the Python script to launch the app's graphical interface.
2. Select the desired conversion mode from the "Select Usage" dropdown menu.
3. Enter the input value and unit in the provided input fields.
4. Select the desired output unit from the dropdown menu.
5. The app will automatically calculate and display the corresponding output value.
6. If needed, you can manually recalculate the output by clicking the "Refresh" button.
